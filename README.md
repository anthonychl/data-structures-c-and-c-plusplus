# Data Structures

This are some examples on data structures like lists, stacks and queues, on C/C++ using functions and classes.

This examples are based on a book by Salvador Pozo Coronado and the examples by Steven R. Davidson.

The original code had some bugs, so the code posted here has my fix for them.
